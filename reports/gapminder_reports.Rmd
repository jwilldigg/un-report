This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.

gapminder_1997 %>% ggplot(aes( x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop/1000000, color = continent)) + labs( x= "life Expectancy", y = "GDP per Capita", title = "Is There a Relationship Between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy") +
